This recipe is easy to make using a pressure cooker, but can be done in a slow cooker with some foresight.

Goes well with [mango salsa](mango-salsa.md)!

# ingredients

**orange mojo sauce**

* 1 cup beer
* 1/2 cup orange juice
* 1/4 cup lime juice
* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper

**additionally**

* 4-5 lbs pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch cubes
* 1 tablespoon high temp cooking oil (avocado, olive, etc)
* fine sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper

# instructions

**prepare the sauce**

In a medium bowl whisk together the mojo sauce ingredients. Set aside.

**sear the pork**

Sear the pork using the oil. Don't be afraid to do this in batches to handle all that pork!

**pressure cook**

Add the pork and mojo sauce to the pressure cooker. Cook on high pressure for 30 minutes, then allow the pressure to release naturally (about 15 minutes).

**shred and broil**

Remove the pork from the pressure cooker and shred. Place on a baking sheet and broil for 4-8 minutes, or until the edges are crispy.
